# Team Profile Generator

<h4>Designed and coded by <a href="https://github.com/Ahsan-Zaidi">Ahsan Zaidi</a></h4>
This project was designed as a homework assignment for UT Austin coding bootcamp. This application emphasizes to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, so I also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

## Getting Started
üîç To get this project up and running, the user should clone the repository from GitHub and download Node. This application also requires a file system and inquirer module. If testing is required, this application uses Jest.

### Summary

This application was created to generate a team profile based on user input using the Inquirer module from Node.js and displaying the information on a newly created html page with a style sheet. This project demonstrates use of OOP and TDD using Jest.

### Goal

Your application should use Jest (Links to an external site.) for running the unit tests and Inquirer (Links to an external site.) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the command node index.js.

### Project Requirements
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer‚Äôs name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern‚Äôs name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
